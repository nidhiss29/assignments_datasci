        "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, as well as in other programming languages, is to organize code in a way that models real-world entities, relationships, and behaviors.\n",
        " OOP aims to provide a more intuitive and modular approach to software development.\n",
        "\n",
        " follows key principles:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Objects:** Objects are instances of classes, which represent real-world entities or concepts. They encapsulate both data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Classes:** A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance:** Inheritance allows you to create a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its attributes and methods. This promotes code reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation restricts direct access to an object's internal state, ensuring that data is accessed and modified only through defined methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
